        <h3>Capturing the dark side.</h3>
        <p style="color:purple;">The 7 October 2019 marks the 60th anniversary of the first image of the ‘dark side’ <br>
            of the Moon (left).This image was taken by the Soviet Luna 3 spacecraft, and while <br>
            the picture is fuzzy and indistinct, this was the first time that this side of the <br>
            Moon had ever been seen.<br>
            The ‘dark side’ of the Moon refers to the hemisphere of the Moon that is facing<br>
            away from the Earth. In reality it is no darker than any other part of the Moon’s<br>
            surface as sunlight does in fact fall equally on all sides of the Moon. It is only ‘dark’<br>
            to us, as that hemisphere can never be viewed from Earth due to a phenomenon<br>
            known as ‘Tidal Locking’. A better term for the side we don’t see is the ‘far side’,<br>
            rather than the ‘dark side’, which leads to all kinds of misconceptions. For<br>
            consistency, we’ll refer to the ‘far side’ for the rest of the article.<br>
